I have created a travellling website which was my first task as a web development intern at NovaNectar Pvt Ltd.
In this website i have created a home page for travelling agency which relies on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had various features in this webpages such as destination guides, Travel itineraries, booking options, user reviews and the contact form for booking the tickets. The user can book tickets for any mode such as flight, car etc.
On conclusion i have learnt how to create responsive buttons, contact form and to insert images.
